wwdumpsnd 0.4 extracts the sound effects and instrument samples from The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker. They are dumped as plain WAVs. To use, all the .aw files from /Audiores/Banks and JaiInit.aaf from /Audiores must be in the current directory when wwdumpsnd is run. 100 MB of WAVs are created.

0.3 fixes some issues with the format of the WAV.
0.4 adds Super Mario Sunshine support thanks to ichifish and Dolphin.

Note that there are some samples that sound quite off, such as in mboss_0.aw. I suspect that these are stereo (the vast majority are mono and that is all I handle) but I haven't worked it out yet.
